# Religion Without Religion<br>
I have always explored. I own and have read at least one major text from every major religion (The Bible, the Quran, the Gita, the Tao Te Ching, the Tibetan Book of the Dead, and many Sutras), as well as multiple texts from other religions. I study, quite actively, the theology of everything I can get my hands on (This blog's name, in fact, comes from a quote from the Talmud).<br>
<br>
I have long suffered from dissatisfaction too: I have practiced many religions, but none have fully satisfied me. The question of why has plagued me for years, and after much meditation, I believe I have an answer, even if my conclusion may change down the line. Regardless, I hope that this will be a helpful story for any who may struggle similarly.<br>
### The History<br>
I was raised with Judaism and Jehovah's Witnesses, but became disinterested around the age of 13. After years of being vaguely agnostic, I struggled in where to start. My first pick was Atheistic Satanism, as I admired the philosophy of Satanism but wasn't ready to be theistic. However, I was put off for the hatred thrown at Christians by organizations and people within the community. <br>
<br>
After a month, I looked into Druidry. It also struck a chord in me, but for a different reason: reverence of the divine in what surrounds us. I was attracted by the lack of an inherent monotheistic deity and the animism present in its philosophy. From here, I got involved in spiritual communities, and this is where it all began.<br>
<br>
That summer, I became polytheistic. I practiced Ptolemaic polytheism at first, and I worshipped Anubis (who I believed-- and still believe has been watching over me) and Aphrodite. Over time, I incorporated Set, Hera, Boreas, and several other Gods into my practice. From then to now, I have toyed with multiple other areas, including Canaanite, Norse, Celtic, and Slavic polytheism, taking away pieces from my experience, but never staying.<br>
<br>
Hinduism, which had caught my interest years before, crept up again, and after a while of studying, I began to practice, syncretizing it with my pagan practice. This was the case for a long time, though I kept exploring, and eventually I picked up Taoism and Shinto as well. Eventually, I switched from Hinduism to Buddhism, and that is where I have stood since.<br>
### What About Monotheism?<br>
In between all of this, other religions piqued my interest quite frequently, including Judaism, Zoroastrianism, Islam, and quite recently Orthodox Christianity. While I studied all immensely, the only one of these I ever fully practiced was Judaism, before I found that ​returning to my old life was no longer fulfilling. While visiting Orthodox churches and Mosques gave me a grand sense of the divine, I found myself feeling hollow.<br>
<br>
This plagued my conscious. Something about monotheism wasn't working for me, but I wasn't sure what that thing was. This became especially apparently recently as I began to look into Orthodox Christianity. It is entrancing to me, and a beautiful tradition. I found myself wanting to believe and practice, but unable to. This was for several reasons.<br>
### Orthodoxy vs Orthopraxy<br>
Firstly, I struggled to come to terms with the idea that one religion of many is true, and that the rest are false. This is ultimately a basis for my polytheism: I function off of the idea that there is some truth in all religions, even if not the full truth. <br>
<br>
Secondly, I addressed the opposite question: Why do I prefer polytheism? Besides the above idea, I came to one conclusion: Orthopraxy. The religions I was drawn to practice were less concerned with right belief and more concerned with right practice. Through this, I discovered a core part of myself-- my reliance on experience. <br>
<br>
It is not that I had bad experiences with x and y religion, and that lead me to leave; every religion I have touched has been a wonderful experience. It is not that I throw the doctrine out either, as they fulfill an important part in religions and are a focus of study whenever I reach out to one.<br>
<br>
A friend told me, "You want to experience faith, not be governed by it." I could not agree with this more. In this way, my religion is a religion without religion, a spiritual experience of the divine with a minimal backbone of beliefs to support it. I believe this is why I find such an attraction to mysticism. Only these experiences can satisfy me; a code of laws or a moral guidebook cannot. <br>
### Ambiguity <br>
I have always felt an anxiety about coming off as airy, wishy-washy, and without a backbone for my ever-evolving beliefs and need to reach out and experience. It begs the question: what do I believe? This is not an easy question to answer, no doubt, and my answer could be different by next month.<br>
<br>
In this way, the hard set beliefs I have are less important to me than the praxis I carry out. If next month, I arrive at the conclusion that reincarnation isn't what happens when we die, little would change about my adoration of and awe towards the divine. I am ultimately dedicated to the spiritual and divine over legalism and rules. My worship of the Gods, spirits, and ancestors prevails my beliefs. Each religion I explore strengthens my personal faith.<br>
### The Future
What does this mean for me? For one, it means worrying less about labels. I am what I am, and trying to define it in "-isms" has only made it more confusing for me. No one label can truly capture my spirituality, and that's okay. I don't need one to. At the end of the day, I know one thing: my love for the divine is eternal.<br>
<br>
It also means comparing myself less to others and worrying less about judgement. I don't always carry the same beliefs with me about the Gods, the spirits, or ancestors, or the nature of the world as other people in my communities, since my spirituality is built on my experience with multiple religions. That is okay, too. I don't have to fit in. <br>
<br>
These conclusions took me years to reach. They are conclusions about myself and my nature; conclusions about who I am and why I prefer what I do. The fight for self-discovery, spiritual and otherwise, is a rough and dirty path. I only hope that these words here may help others find themselves, too. <br>
