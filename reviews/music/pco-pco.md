# Penguin Cafe Orchestra - A Lament For Childhood<br>
<br>
Something about Penguin Cafe Orchestra captivated me instantly. Perhaps it was their eloquent style, their mystical instrumentation, or the childlike naivety that prevades their songs. Between the beautiful innocence of Air à danser and the rubato melancholy of Flux, there is a deep sense of passion that prevades every melody. Each song expresses unique introspective feelings: a longing for childhood discovery (Cutting Branches for a Temporary Shelter), a sense of carefree and joyful adventure (Pythagoras's Trousers), and even a tranquil mist of self-reflection (Simon's Dream).<br>
<br>
Not only is Penguin Cafe Orchestra diverse in their expression, but also in their influence and style. The late producer and multi-instrumentalist Simon Jeffes was well travelled, gathering various ideas in Japan as he learned about ethnic music and wrote poetry about a fictional Penguin Cafe Orchestra which played music in the Penguin Cafe, a place which freely expressed the spontaneity which Jeffes dreamt anarchy and disorder would destroy. With his inspirations and his poetry, Jeffes went on to create the band of his dreams, a band with "a message whispered to the heart".<br>
<br>
Despite Jeffes's unfortunate death to a brain tumor in 1997, his legacy lives on in his brilliant works. Penguin Cafe Orchestra is an album so filled with raw emotion, passion, and love that it will leave you crying despite its captivated wonder. It is not simply an album, but a lament for the journey of self-realisation that we all must endure as we spontaneously grow- a journey that never ends until our passing.<br>

"I am the proprietor of the Penguin Cafe, I will tell you things at random."<br>
