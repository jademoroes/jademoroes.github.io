Presumably, in the Perimeter are a number of versions of myself. Here is a census of all of the known denizens of the Perimeters. These are native, not to be confused with [Guests, or Paras](), who are walk-ins and the objects of maladaptive daydreaming. Each name is a dropdown.<br>

  <i>Amadeus is the sister of Fen, presumably formed around the same time as her. While Fen is a replication of our femininity and naivety at the age of 14~16, Amadeus is the opposite side of the coin, a replication of our masculinity and our faith at the same age.</i><br>
  <i>It is also possible that Amadeus's name was pulled straight from Amadeus Mozart, considering his affinity for music.</i><br>
